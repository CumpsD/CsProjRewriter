# csproj-rewriter [![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/exira/csproj-rewriter.png)](https://travis-ci.org/exira/csproj-rewriter)

Merging .csproj files is a hell, one that we had to face once too many when merging pull requests.

So we quickly wrote something which rewrites .csproj files to have all items ordered alphabetically, making merging easier.

If you can use it, enjoy!
